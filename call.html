                    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                    <p>
                    Immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR, AR, and MR), which are often referred to as a universal term - extended reality (XR), have enabled numerous
                    appealing applications in education, training, entertainment, and healthcare. Emerging applications and systems enabled by AR/VR/MR, especially the burgeoning metaverse, naturally
                    involve multiple geographically distributed users interacting and communicating over the Internet. Given its interdisciplinary nature, XR has been extensively investigated in computer
                    graphics, computer vision, and human-computer interaction communities. Nonetheless, XR and the metaverse put more strain on the underlying networks and systems to deliver high-quality
                    immersive content in real time and guarantee a satisfactory user experience, which is still underexplored in the mobile computing and networking community.</p>

                    <p>This Workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers, practitioners, and policymakers from academia, industry, and government to discuss the latest research and identify future
                       opportunities for mobile immersive computing, networking, and systems. It solicits high-quality original research and novel developments that promote innovations to advance mobile
                       immersive content delivery, AR/VR/MR, and the metaverse. It also welcomes papers that summarize research challenges, survey existing solutions, and/or propose visionary solutions to
                       ongoing issues in mobile XR and the metaverse.</p>
